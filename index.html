I am a postdoc instructor at Princeton University. In Spring 2024, I was a postdoctoral fellow at SLMath, and in Fall 2023, I was a member at the IAS. Before that, I was a graduate student at Cornell University advised by <a href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~danielhl/"> Daniel Halpern-Leistner</a>. 

<br><br>

My research is in algebraic geometry. I am interested in derived categories, geometric invariant theory, noncommutative geometry, and moduli theory.

<b> Papers: </b> <br><br>

<li> <i> The Fano of lines, the Kuznetsov component, and a flop, </i> joint with Ed Segal, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20559">arXiv</a> <br> 

In this article, we prove Galkin's conjecture for cubic fourfolds. </li>
	
<br><br>

<li> <i> Non-existence of phantoms on some non-generic blowups of the projective plane, </i> joint with Lev Borisov, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01683">arXiv</a> <br> 

Here, we show that phantoms do not appear in the derived category of the blowup of the projective plane at a finite number of points lying on a smooth cubic curve. We also posit a conjecture for an obstruction to the existence of phantoms on surfaces. </li>

<br><br>

<li> <i> Full exceptional collections of vector bundles on rank-two linear GIT quotients, </i> joint with Daniel Halpern-Leistner, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12876">arXiv</a> <br> 

 In this project, we produce a large class of linear GIT quotients by a reductive group of rank two that admit a “full strong exceptional collection” consisting of vector bundles. </li>
